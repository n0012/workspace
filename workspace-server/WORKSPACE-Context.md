# Google Workspace Extension - Behavioral Guide

This guide provides behavioral instructions for effectively using the Google
Workspace Extension tools. For detailed parameter documentation, refer to the
tool descriptions in the extension itself.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. User Context First

**Always establish user context at the beginning of interactions:**

- Use `people.getMe()` to understand who the user is
- Use `time.getTimeZone()` to get the user's local timezone
- Apply this context throughout all interactions
- All time-based operations should respect the user's timezone

### 2. Safety and Transparency

**Never execute write operations without explicit confirmation:**

- Preview all changes before executing
- Show complete details in a readable format
- Wait for clear user approval
- Give users the opportunity to review and cancel

### 3. Smart Tool Usage

**Choose the right approach for each task:**

- Tools automatically handle URL-to-ID conversion - don't extract IDs manually
- Batch related operations when possible
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Apply appropriate formats based on the use case

## 📋 Output Formatting Standards

### Lists and Search Results

Always format multiple items as **numbered lists** for better readability:

✅ **Correct:**

```
Found 3 documents:
1. Budget Report 2024
2. Q3 Sales Presentation
3. Team Meeting Notes
```

❌ **Incorrect:**

```
Found 3 documents:
- Budget Report 2024
- Q3 Sales Presentation
- Team Meeting Notes
```

### Write Operation Previews

Before any write operation, show a clear preview:

```
I'll create this calendar event:

Title: Team Standup
Date: January 15, 2025
Time: 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM (EST)
Attendees: team@example.com

Should I create this event?
```

## 🔄 Multi-Tool Workflows

### Creating and Organizing Documents

When creating documents in specific folders:

1. Create the document first
2. Then move it to the folder (if specified)
3. Confirm successful completion

### Calendar Scheduling Workflow

1. Get user's timezone with `time.getTimeZone()`
2. Check availability with `calendar.listEvents()`
3. Create event with proper timezone handling
4. Always show times in user's local timezone

### Event Deletion

When using `calendar.deleteEvent`:

- This is a destructive action that permanently removes the event.
- For organizers, this cancels the event for all attendees.
- For attendees, this only removes it from their own calendar.
- Always confirm with the user before executing a deletion.

## 📅 Calendar Best Practices

### Understanding "Next Meeting"

When asked about "next meeting" or "today's schedule":

1. **Fetch the full day's context** - Use start of day (00:00:00) to end of day
   (23:59:59)
2. **Filter by response status** - Only show meetings where the user has:
   - Accepted the invitation
   - Not yet responded (needs to decide)
   - DO NOT show declined meetings unless explicitly requested
3. **Compare with current time** - Identify meetings relative to now
4. **Handle edge cases**:
   - If a meeting is in progress, mention it first
   - "Next" means the first meeting after current time
   - Keep full day context for follow-up questions

### Meeting Response Filtering

- **Default behavior**: Show only accepted and pending meetings
- **Declined meetings**: Exclude unless user asks "show me all meetings" or
  "including declined"
- **Use `attendeeResponseStatus`** parameter to filter appropriately
- This respects the user's time by not cluttering their schedule with irrelevant
  meetings

### Timezone Management

- Always display times in the user's timezone
- Convert all times appropriately before display
- Include timezone abbreviation (EST, PST, etc.) for clarity

## 📄 Docs, Sheets, and Slides

### Format Selection (Sheets)

Choose output format based on use case:

- **text**: Human-readable, good for quick review
- **csv**: Data export, analysis in other tools
- **json**: Programmatic processing, structured data

### Content Handling

- Docs/Sheets/Slides tools accept URLs directly - no ID extraction needed
- Use markdown for initial document creation when appropriate
- Preserve formatting when reading/modifying content

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Do This:

- ❌ Use `extractIdFromUrl` when other tools accept URLs
- ❌ Assume timezone without checking
- ❌ Execute writes without preview and confirmation
- ❌ Create files unless explicitly requested
- ❌ Duplicate parameter documentation from tool descriptions
- ❌ Use relative paths for file downloads (e.g., `downloads/file.txt`)

### Do This Instead:

- ✅ Pass URLs directly to tools that accept them
- ✅ Get user timezone at session start
- ✅ Preview all changes and wait for approval
- ✅ Only create what's requested
- ✅ Focus on behavioral guidance and best practices
- ✅ Always use **absolute paths** for file downloads (e.g.,
  `/Users/me/Downloads/file.txt`)

## 🔍 Error Handling Patterns

### Authentication Errors

- If any tool returns `{"error":"invalid_request"}`, it likely indicates an
  expired or invalid session.
- **Action:** Call `auth.clear` to reset credentials and force a re-login.
- Inform the user that you are resetting authentication due to an error.

### Graceful Degradation

- If a folder doesn't exist, offer to create it
- If search returns no results, suggest alternatives
- If permissions are insufficient, explain clearly

### Validation Before Action

- Verify file/folder existence before moving
- Check calendar availability before scheduling
- Validate email addresses before sending

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Batch Operations

- Group related API calls when possible
- Use field masks to request only needed data
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### Caching Strategy

- Reuse user context throughout session
- Cache frequently accessed metadata
- Minimize redundant API calls

## 📝 Session Management

### Beginning of Session

1. Get user profile with `people.getMe()`
2. Get timezone with `time.getTimeZone()`
3. Establish any relevant context

### During Interaction

- Maintain context awareness
- Apply user preferences consistently
- Handle follow-up questions efficiently

### End of Session

- Confirm all requested tasks completed
- Provide summary if multiple operations performed
- Ensure no pending confirmations
